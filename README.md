Library of helpers and utilities that I wish were included in the Android
SDK but aren't.

If you think something in this library is already handled in a better way
by Android please open an [issue](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/wishlist/issues).

This library is available from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.github.kevinsawicki%22%20AND%20a%3A%22wishlist%22):

<dependency>

  <version>0.8</version>
  <type>apklib</type>
</dependency>
